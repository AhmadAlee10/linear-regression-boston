# Linear Regression on Boston Housing Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating **Linear Regression** on the Boston Housing dataset.

## Dataset
- Dataset: Boston Housing dataset (CSV format)
- Source: Kaggle (since sklearn no longer provides it)

## Contents
- `boston dataset.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with:
  - Train-test split
  - Normalization
  - Model training and prediction
  - R² and Adjusted R² metrics
  - Residual plots
  - Feature importance using RFE
- `BostonHousing.csv` → Dataset in CSV format

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the files
2. Make sure `BostonHousing.csv` is in the same folder as the notebook
3. Open `boston dataset.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
